# Quik-Drop-3DS
"Quik-Drop 3DS" is a clone of the arcade game "Quik-Drop."

# If you didn't know...
"Quik-Drop" is an arcade game made by Bay Tek Entertainment.
It's a game where you have to drop 50 balls within the time limit 
for them to drop into buckets.

# Fair Warning...
This is obviously NOT a 1 to 1 replica of the original.
But, it does have some things which may be useful if
you want to get into 3DS Homebrew yourself.

This game was written in C++ based on C libraries,
so get at least a somewhat good understanding of
C++ before delving into a project like this.

# Build Project
If you have devkitPro and libctru installed, you just extract
the top directory (3ds-template-master) and
type "make" into a CMD prompt or VS Code
terminal.
